# Schedules & Recurring Jobs

Create recurring repo jobs that run reusable prompts against a repository, store run history, and link every run back to a normal OpenCode session.

## What Schedules Are Good For

Schedules make OpenCode Manager proactive instead of purely session-driven. Good examples include:

- **Repo health reports** for a quick morning review
- **Dependency watchlists** to catch upgrade pressure early
- **Release readiness checks** before a ship window
- **Docs drift reviews** to spot stale setup instructions
- **Tech debt triage** for recurring cleanup planning

Each run is stored with status, timestamps, logs, assistant output, and a linked session you can open and continue.

## Creating a Schedule

1. Open a repository
2. Click **Schedules**
3. Click **New Schedule**
4. Configure the job name, prompt, timing, and optional overrides
5. Save the schedule

The schedule is scoped to the current repository.

## Timing Options

The schedule builder supports both simple presets and advanced cron:

- **Interval** - Repeat every N minutes
- **Hourly** - Run once each hour at a chosen minute
- **Daily** - Run once per day at a chosen time
- **Weekdays** - Run Monday through Friday
- **Weekly** - Pick one or more weekdays and a time
- **Monthly** - Run on a day of the month
- **Advanced** - Enter a cron expression directly

Cron-based schedules also store a timezone so runs happen when expected.

## Prompt Templates

Built-in prompt templates help you start quickly with recurring jobs like:

- Repo health report
- Dependency watchlist
- Release readiness review
- Test stability audit
- Docs drift review
- Tech debt triage
- Security and config review
- CI and ops review

Applying a template fills the schedule name, description, and prompt so you can customize from a strong default instead of starting from scratch.

## Agent and Model Overrides

Schedules can run with:

- the default workspace agent and model
- a custom agent slug
- a specific model override when needed

If a requested model is no longer available, OpenCode Manager falls back to a valid configured model for that provider so the run can still start when possible.

## Run History

Each schedule stores a run history panel with:

- **Status** - Running, completed, or failed
- **Trigger source** - Manual or scheduled
- **Log output** - Execution metadata and captured results
- **Assistant output** - Rendered markdown preview and raw markdown
- **Errors** - Failure details when a run does not complete

This makes recurring jobs easy to review without digging through raw session data first.

## Linked Sessions

Every run creates or attaches to a normal OpenCode session.

Use **Open session** when you want to:

- inspect the original conversation
- continue from the generated report
- answer follow-up questions from the agent
- debug provider, permission, or tool issues

This keeps automation connected to the rest of the OpenCode Manager workflow instead of creating a separate silo.

## Best Practices

- Keep prompts focused on one recurring outcome
- Prefer a few high-value schedules per repo over many overlapping jobs
- Use manual runs to validate a prompt before relying on the schedule
- Review failed runs quickly so broken provider or permission setups do not go unnoticed
- Treat schedules as reusable repo routines, not long-running background workers

## Troubleshooting

### Run Failed

1. Open the run from **Run History**
2. Check the **Error** tab for the failure message
3. Use **Open session** to inspect the underlying session
4. Verify provider credentials, model availability, and any pending agent questions or permissions

### No Assistant Output

If a run starts but does not produce assistant output:

1. Open the linked session
2. Check for a provider error
3. Check whether the agent asked a question or needed permission
4. Re-run the schedule manually after fixing the issue

### Prompt Needs Iteration

Use **Run now** to test prompt changes immediately before waiting for the next scheduled run.
